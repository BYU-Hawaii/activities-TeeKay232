        <h3>Some good food</h3>
        <p>The food in Aotearoa is just soo good. We have bakeries, sushi places, and Turkish places, there are so many places to eat and all the food tastes amazing.
            Some of my favorite foods come from bakeries like meat pies and pizza bread, there is just so much good food.
