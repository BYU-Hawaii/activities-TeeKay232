        <h3>Welcome to Whangarei</h3>
        <p>Whangarei is my home town. Technically I didn't live in Whangarei for that long, but I to school there all my life,
            I would even travel 45 mins just to get to school. I know that town like the back of my hand.<br>
            Whangarei isn't a big city, but its just bigger than a town so its a city. It was a harbor in the downtown area and has 
            one of the coolest playgrounds ever.
