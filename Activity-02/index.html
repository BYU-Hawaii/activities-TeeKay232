    <strong style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Hello Everyone!!</strong>
    <p>My name is Te-Kaha but my nickname is TK.<br>I come from <mark style="background-color:aqua">Aoteraoa, New Zealand</mark>. I grew up in a small town called <i>Whangarei</i>. My favourite color is purple and my favourite food is Lasagne.
    I am 22 years of age and I really like playing and listening to music, I also like playing video games. My favourite video game is <del>Call of Duty</del>, sorry I meant to say <sub>Team Fortress 2</sub> .</p>
    <p>I also like to be outside. Either its playing sports or camping I love being outside. Some of the many sports I have played over the years are: Badminton, Rugby, Soccer, Gymnastics, Weight-lifing. Yeah and camping is really fun too. 
        I love being out in the woods looking at the stars next to a camp fire. Very soothing.</p>
