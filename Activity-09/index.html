            <h3>Blue Jay Food</h3>
            <p class="text">
                Blue jays are omnivorous birds with a diverse diet that varies depending on the season and availability of food. 
                They are known to consume a wide range of items, including nuts, seeds, fruits, insects, and small vertebrates. 
                During the warmer months, blue jays primarily feed on nuts, seeds, and fruits such as acorns, beech nuts, berries, and cherries.

            <h3>Where do blue jays live?</h3>
            <p class="text">
                Blue jays are highly adaptable birds found across a vast range of habitats throughout North America, from dense forests and woodlands to urban parks and suburban areas. 
                They are particularly abundant in mixed deciduous and coniferous forests, where they can forage for nuts, seeds, and insects among the trees.
                Blue jays are also commonly spotted in residential areas with ample tree cover, where they build their nests and take advantage of bird feeders.
